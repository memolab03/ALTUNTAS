#ABOUT ME

I'm a former software developer, a former software tester. Now I am an IT system supervisor in an institution. I took part in about 15 different testnet projects and I did node tests in these projects with nearly 200 server installations.

I have nearly 15 years of experience in technology.  I can even provide software support to blockchain projects with a little training.  I want to learn this business in depth and if you give me a chance you will see how I contribute to your project.  If you wish, you can also recruit as an apprentice to the team.  Or you can consider me for the positions below.

I would like to promote your project in Turkish and English in Turkey and in the world, and make a lot of content and sharing that will contribute to the community.  I can design a website and announce your project to the people here, I can provide events, I can act as an ambassador.  I can manage social media and telegram groups where we will share our knowledge and skills on Testnet.
